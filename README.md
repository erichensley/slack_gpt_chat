## Crapbot6001

Crapbot6001 is a context-aware chatbot that uses GPT-3, Pinecone, and Slack to generate responses and images based on user input. It features real-time interaction and can provide context-aware responses and images.

### Image generation

Crapbot6001 can create images based on user input. The chatbot sends image prompts generated by GPT-3 to an external image generation service and shares the generated images in the Slack channel.

### Pinecone integration

Pinecone is a vector search engine that helps the chatbot efficiently retrieve relevant messages from its database. It indexes messages using GPT-3 embeddings and performs similarity search to find related messages in the conversation history.

### Slack integration

The chatbot uses Slack Bolt framework and Socket Mode to handle events and send responses in real-time. It listens to messages in the Slack workspace, processes them, and generates responses without any server setup or webhook configuration.

## Usage

To use Crapbot6001 in your Slack workspace, set up the required API keys and tokens for OpenAI, Pinecone, and Slack. Then, run the chat.py script to start the chatbot. The bot will listen to messages in the workspace and respond to them with context-aware responses and images.

Crapbot6001 also supports a /image command for generating images. To use the command, type /image <your-text> in the Slack channel, and the bot will generate an image based on the provided text.

## Configuration

The chatbot's behavior and responses can be customized by modifying the following configuration files:

    config/phrases.txt: Contains phrases used to construct the chatbot's personality.
    config/conversation_content.txt: Contains sample conversation content for GPT-3 prompt.
    config/personality.txt: Defines the chatbot's personality and behavior.
    config/prompt_image.txt: Provides the initial prompt for image generation.

Make sure to set the appropriate API keys, tokens, and settings in config/api_keys.py for OpenAI, Pinecone, and Slack integration.
